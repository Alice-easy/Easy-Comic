# Manga Reader Quality Improvements - Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This specification addresses critical quality improvements for the Easy Comic manga reader application to achieve production-ready quality (95%+ score). The improvements focus on completing stubbed implementations, fixing architectural issues, and optimizing performance based on validation feedback identifying specific gaps in functional completeness, code quality, and memory management.

## 2. High Priority Requirements

### 2.1 Complete Progress Persistence System

**User Story**: As a reader, I want my reading progress to be automatically saved and restored across app sessions, so that I can seamlessly continue reading from where I left off without losing my place.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I navigate between pages in a comic, THEN my current page position SHALL be automatically saved to the database within 2 seconds
2. WHEN I close and reopen the app, THEN I SHALL be returned to the exact page I was reading with visual confirmation
3. WHEN progress saving fails due to database errors, THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff and display appropriate error messaging
4. WHEN multiple comics are open simultaneously, THEN each comic's progress SHALL be tracked independently without interference
5. WHEN I reach the end of a comic, THEN the completion status SHALL be marked and synchronized with the WebDAV backend if configured

### 2.2 Intelligent Page Preloading System

**User Story**: As a reader, I want pages to load instantly when I navigate through a comic, so that my reading experience is smooth and uninterrupted by loading delays.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN I am reading a comic, THEN the next 3 pages SHALL be preloaded with high priority and cached in memory
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% of available memory, THEN the preloading system SHALL reduce cache size and prioritize only the next page
3. WHEN I navigate to a new page, THEN the image SHALL display within 100ms if preloaded, or show a loading indicator if not cached
4. WHEN preloading fails for specific pages, THEN the system SHALL retry with progressive quality reduction (high -> medium -> low) 
5. WHEN the app goes to background, THEN preloading SHALL be paused to preserve battery and resumed when the app becomes active

### 2.3 Enhanced Error Boundary System

**User Story**: As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I can continue using the application even when unexpected issues occur.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the error boundary is initialized, THEN it SHALL preserve any existing Flutter error handlers rather than overwriting them
2. WHEN an error occurs in the reader interface, THEN the error SHALL be logged with full context and a user-friendly message displayed
3. WHEN critical errors occur, THEN the user SHALL have options to retry the operation, report the error, or return to a safe state
4. WHEN errors are reported, THEN they SHALL include device information, app state, and anonymized user actions for debugging
5. WHEN the app is in development mode, THEN detailed error information SHALL be displayed to developers

## 3. Medium Priority Requirements

### 3.1 Performance and Memory Optimization

**User Story**: As a user with a device that has limited memory, I want the app to run smoothly without crashes or slowdowns, so that I can enjoy reading comics regardless of my device specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the app detects available device memory, THEN it SHALL adjust cache limits dynamically (low-end: 50MB, mid-range: 100MB, high-end: 200MB)
2. WHEN memory pressure is detected, THEN the app SHALL aggressively clean up cached images and notify the user of memory optimization actions
3. WHEN large comic files are processed, THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading with size limits based on device capabilities
4. WHEN the app runs for extended periods, THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without continuous growth (memory leaks)
5. WHEN performance metrics indicate degradation, THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality settings and cache behavior

### 3.2 Configuration Management System

**User Story**: As a power user, I want to customize performance settings and technical parameters, so that I can optimize the app's behavior for my specific device and usage patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the app initializes, THEN configuration values SHALL be loaded from external configuration files rather than hard-coded constants
2. WHEN I access advanced settings, THEN I SHALL be able to modify cache sizes, preloading behavior, and performance thresholds
3. WHEN configuration changes are made, THEN they SHALL be applied immediately without requiring app restart
4. WHEN invalid configuration values are detected, THEN the system SHALL fall back to safe defaults and warn the user
5. WHEN the app updates, THEN existing user configurations SHALL be preserved and migrated to new format if necessary

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Database Integration Requirements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A new `ComicProgress` table SHALL be created with columns: id, comicId, currentPage, lastReadTime, totalPages, isCompleted, syncStatus
2. Progress updates SHALL be batched to reduce database writes (maximum 1 write per 2 seconds per comic)
3. Database operations SHALL use transactions to ensure data consistency
4. Offline progress SHALL be queued and synchronized when network connectivity is restored

### 4.2 Cache Service Enhancement Requirements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The cache service SHALL implement priority-based eviction (current page: never evict, next 3 pages: high priority, others: low priority)
2. Preloading SHALL be implemented with configurable concurrency limits (default: 2 concurrent loads)
3. Cache statistics SHALL be tracked and exposed for performance monitoring
4. Disk cache SHALL complement memory cache for persistent storage of frequently accessed pages

### 4.3 Error Handling Architecture Requirements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Error handlers SHALL be chained rather than replaced to preserve existing functionality
2. Context-aware error reporting SHALL include current comic, page, and user action
3. Error recovery strategies SHALL be implemented for common failure scenarios (network, storage, memory)
4. Development and production error handling modes SHALL be clearly differentiated

## 5. Performance Targets

### 5.1 Response Time Requirements
- Page navigation: < 100ms for cached pages, < 500ms for uncached pages
- Progress saving: < 2 seconds from user action to database persistence
- App startup: < 3 seconds to display last read comic
- Error recovery: < 1 second to display error UI and recovery options

### 5.2 Memory Usage Requirements
- Base memory usage: < 100MB for app without comics loaded
- Per-comic memory overhead: < 50MB including cache and metadata
- Cache eviction trigger: 80% of available memory on low-end devices, 90% on high-end devices
- Memory leak prevention: No continuous growth over 24-hour usage sessions

### 5.3 Reliability Requirements
- Progress save success rate: > 99.9%
- Error boundary coverage: 100% of user-facing components
- Crash prevention: < 0.1% crash rate in production
- Data consistency: 100% accuracy in progress tracking and synchronization

## 6. Quality Assurance Requirements

### 6.1 Testing Coverage Requirements
- Unit test coverage: > 90% for business logic components
- Integration test coverage: 100% for critical user flows (reading, progress saving, error handling)
- Performance test coverage: Memory usage, response times, and stability under load
- Error scenario testing: Network failures, storage issues, memory pressure, and data corruption

### 6.2 Monitoring and Observability Requirements
- Real-time performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring with alerting thresholds
- User experience analytics for reading patterns and performance issues
- Automated quality gates in CI/CD pipeline preventing regressions

3. Page preloading system delivers sub-100ms navigation for cached content
4. Memory management keeps the app stable during extended reading sessions
5. Configuration system allows runtime tuning of performance parameters
6. Overall application quality score reaches 95%+ in validation assessments
7. Production crash rate remains below 0.1% with comprehensive error recovery
