# Reader Architecture Consolidation Requirements

## Introduction

Based on quality assessment feedback (68/100), the Easy Comic reader has critical architectural inconsistencies that must be resolved. This specification addresses the core issues: duplicated models, unused strategy patterns, service conflicts, and overly complex ReaderPage implementation. The goal is to create a unified, maintainable reader architecture that follows practical patterns while ensuring 95%+ quality.

## 1. Architecture Consolidation

**User Story**: As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a single, consistent reader architecture so that the code is maintainable and bug-free.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN examining reader models, THEN there SHALL be only one reader_models.dart file with consistent enum definitions
2. WHEN checking brightness services, THEN there SHALL be only one BrightnessService implementation with unified API
3. WHEN reviewing strategy pattern usage, THEN the pattern SHALL be either fully implemented and used OR completely removed
4. WHEN analyzing provider types, THEN all providers SHALL match their expected consumer types without casting

## 2. ReaderPage Simplification

**User Story**: As a developer working on reader features, I want a manageable ReaderPage implementation so that adding new features is straightforward and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN reviewing ReaderPage code, THEN it SHALL be under 500 lines by extracting logical components
2. WHEN examining reader functionality, THEN each feature SHALL have clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN testing reader components, THEN each extracted component SHALL be independently testable
4. WHEN adding new reader features, THEN the architecture SHALL support extension without major refactoring

## 3. Dead Code Elimination

**User Story**: As a developer maintaining code quality, I want to remove unused implementations so that the codebase is clean and focused.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN scanning for unused strategy implementations, THEN they SHALL be removed if not integrated with ReaderPage
2. WHEN checking for redundant services, THEN duplicate implementations SHALL be consolidated into single services
3. WHEN reviewing UI components, THEN unused widgets SHALL be removed or properly integrated
4. WHEN examining imports, THEN all imported modules SHALL be actively used

## 4. Performance Foundation

**User Story**: As a user reading comics, I want smooth performance without memory issues so that my reading experience is enjoyable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN loading comic pages, THEN images SHALL be cached to prevent redundant loading
2. WHEN navigating between pages, THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without leaks
3. WHEN performing database operations, THEN redundant queries SHALL be eliminated through proper state management
4. WHEN switching between comics, THEN previous comic resources SHALL be properly disposed

## 5. Type Safety and Error Handling

**User Story**: As a user of the application, I want reliable functionality without crashes so that I can read comics without interruption.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN providers are consumed, THEN type mismatches SHALL be resolved without runtime casting
2. WHEN services are called, THEN error conditions SHALL be handled gracefully with user feedback
3. WHEN models are used across components, THEN they SHALL have consistent field definitions and types
4. WHEN async operations fail, THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive with appropriate error messages

## 6. Configuration Management

**User Story**: As a user customizing reading preferences, I want consistent settings behavior so that my preferences are reliably applied.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN brightness is adjusted, THEN the setting SHALL be persisted and consistently applied
2. WHEN reading modes are changed, THEN the UI SHALL immediately reflect the new mode
3. WHEN navigation preferences are set, THEN they SHALL work consistently across all reading modes
4. WHEN bookmarks are managed, THEN operations SHALL be reliable and immediately visible

## Success Criteria

- **Code Quality**: Achieve 95%+ in quality assessment with no critical or major architectural issues
- **Maintainability**: ReaderPage under 500 lines with clear component separation
- **Performance**: Smooth scrolling with stable memory usage during extended reading sessions
- **Reliability**: Zero crashes related to type mismatches or service conflicts
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for all models, services, and configurations
