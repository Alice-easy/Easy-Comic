# Easy Comic Reader Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines enhancements to the Easy Comic reader application to provide advanced reading features including brightness control, page management, reading strategies, and UI improvements. The enhancements maintain compatibility with the existing Flutter + Riverpod + Drift + PhotoView architecture while addressing critical platform implementation gaps and architectural inconsistencies.

## Requirements

### 1. Platform-Native Brightness Control System

**User Story:** As a comic reader, I want automatic brightness adjustment for comfortable reading in different lighting conditions, so that I can read without eye strain.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN I open the reader, THEN the system SHALL detect current device brightness
2. WHEN I adjust brightness using reader controls, THEN the system SHALL update device brightness natively on Android and iOS
3. WHEN I enable auto-brightness, THEN the system SHALL adjust brightness based on time of day (night: 0.2, morning/evening: 0.5, day: 0.8)
4. WHEN I close the reader, THEN the system SHALL restore original brightness levels
5. WHEN brightness control fails on a platform, THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback without crashes
6. WHEN the app lacks brightness permissions on Android, THEN the system SHALL display appropriate permission request dialogs

**Platform Implementation Requirements:**
- Android: Native MethodChannel implementation with WRITE_SETTINGS permission handling
- iOS: Native MethodChannel implementation using UIScreen.main.brightness
- Windows/macOS/Linux: Best-effort implementation with graceful degradation

### 2. Unified State Management Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent state management throughout the application, so that the codebase is maintainable and testable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN implementing new features, THEN the system SHALL use Riverpod exclusively for state management
2. WHEN migrating existing BLoC code, THEN the system SHALL replace all BLoC patterns with Riverpod equivalents
3. WHEN managing reader state, THEN the system SHALL use AsyncNotifier and StateNotifier patterns
4. WHEN handling errors, THEN the system SHALL use AsyncValue error states consistently
5. WHEN testing components, THEN the system SHALL provide mockable provider overrides

### 3. Advanced Page Management System

**User Story:** As a comic reader, I want to reorder pages and manage reading sequences, so that I can customize my reading experience for different comic formats.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN I access page management, THEN the system SHALL display a thumbnail grid of all pages
2. WHEN I drag a page thumbnail, THEN the system SHALL allow reordering with visual feedback
3. WHEN I save page order changes, THEN the system SHALL persist the custom order in the database
4. WHEN I reset page order, THEN the system SHALL restore original file sequence
5. WHEN I navigate in the reader, THEN the system SHALL follow the custom page order
6. WHEN page reordering fails, THEN the system SHALL display error messages and maintain original order

**Technical Requirements:**
- Drag-and-drop interface using ReorderableListView
- Database schema extension for custom page orders
- Memory-efficient thumbnail generation
- Undo/redo functionality for order changes

### 4. Reading Strategy System

**User Story:** As a comic reader, I want different reading modes (single page, dual page, continuous scroll), so that I can choose the best format for different types of comics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN I select single page mode, THEN the system SHALL display one page at a time with page-by-page navigation
2. WHEN I select dual page mode, THEN the system SHALL display two pages side-by-side with proper alignment
3. WHEN I select continuous scroll mode, THEN the system SHALL display pages in a vertical scrollable list
4. WHEN switching reading modes, THEN the system SHALL maintain current reading position
5. WHEN in dual page mode with odd page count, THEN the system SHALL handle the last single page gracefully
6. WHEN zooming in any mode, THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate zoom constraints

**Strategy Implementation:**
- Abstract ReadingStrategy base class
- Concrete strategy implementations for each mode
- Strategy switching without reader restart
- Position preservation across strategy changes

### 5. Enhanced Reader UI Components

**User Story:** As a comic reader, I want intuitive controls and visual feedback, so that I can focus on reading without UI distractions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN I tap the screen center, THEN the system SHALL toggle control visibility with smooth animations
2. WHEN I view the thumbnail progress bar, THEN the system SHALL show current position and allow direct navigation
3. WHEN I open reader settings, THEN the system SHALL provide a slide-out panel with all reading options
4. WHEN I access page manager, THEN the system SHALL show a modal dialog with thumbnail grid and reorder controls
5. WHEN UI elements animate, THEN the system SHALL use consistent Material Design transitions
6. WHEN on small screens, THEN the system SHALL adapt UI layout for optimal space usage

**Component Architecture:**
- Modular widget composition with clear separation of concerns
- Responsive design patterns for different screen sizes
- Consistent theming and animation patterns
- Accessibility support with semantic labels

### 6. Performance and Memory Optimization

**User Story:** As a user with large comic files, I want smooth performance and efficient memory usage, so that the app remains responsive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN loading large comics, THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading with maximum 3 pages in memory
2. WHEN generating thumbnails, THEN the system SHALL cache results and limit memory usage to 50MB
3. WHEN switching pages rapidly, THEN the system SHALL preload adjacent pages without blocking UI
4. WHEN memory pressure occurs, THEN the system SHALL release non-essential cached resources
5. WHEN processing very large images, THEN the system SHALL resize appropriately for display resolution
6. WHEN app backgrounds, THEN the system SHALL reduce memory footprint by clearing non-essential caches

### 7. Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and graceful recovery, so that I can understand and resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN file loading fails, THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with recovery suggestions
2. WHEN platform features are unavailable, THEN the system SHALL provide alternative functionality
3. WHEN network operations fail, THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN database operations fail, THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain data consistency
5. WHEN critical errors occur, THEN the system SHALL report to crash analytics while protecting user privacy
6. WHEN errors affect reading experience, THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery

### 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the application remains stable and reliable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN implementing platform channels, THEN the system SHALL provide complete mock implementations for testing
2. WHEN testing UI components, THEN the system SHALL include widget tests for all interactive elements
3. WHEN testing business logic, THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 90% code coverage
4. WHEN testing async operations, THEN the system SHALL use proper test helpers and fixtures
5. WHEN testing error conditions, THEN the system SHALL verify error handling and recovery paths
6. WHEN testing platform features, THEN the system SHALL include integration tests on actual devices
