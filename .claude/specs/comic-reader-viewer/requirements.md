# Comic Reader Viewer Component - Requirements Specification

## Introduction

This document outlines the refined requirements for enhancing the existing Flutter-based comic reader application's core viewer component. Based on quality validation feedback (76/100 score), this specification addresses critical interface integration gaps, architecture coupling issues, and performance optimization requirements to achieve professional-grade reading experience.

The viewer component serves as the central reading interface that must integrate seamlessly with existing services through well-defined interfaces while maintaining 60fps performance and comprehensive error recovery mechanisms.

## Requirements

### 1. Interface Integration and Service Contracts

**User Story**: As a development system, I need clearly defined service interfaces with complete method signatures and dependency injection patterns, so that components can integrate seamlessly without tight coupling.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1.1. GIVEN the ICacheService interface exists, WHEN the preloading engine needs to cache images, THEN the interface SHALL include a `preloadPages(List<String> pageKeys, int currentPageIndex)` method that returns `Future<void>`.

1.2. GIVEN progressive image loading is required, WHEN image quality needs adjustment, THEN the ICacheService interface SHALL include a `setImageQuality(String pageKey, ImageQuality quality)` method that returns `Future<void>`.

1.3. GIVEN dependency injection is needed, WHEN components are instantiated, THEN all service dependencies SHALL be injected through constructors using GetIt service locator with interface abstractions.

1.4. GIVEN the ReaderBloc needs cache operations, WHEN accessing cache functionality, THEN it SHALL depend only on ICacheService interface and NOT on concrete CacheService implementation.

1.5. GIVEN interface contracts must be consistent, WHEN implementing services, THEN all interface methods SHALL have matching implementations with identical method signatures and return types.

### 2. Architecture Decoupling and Component Design

**User Story**: As a software architect, I need loosely coupled components with proper abstraction layers, so that the system maintains flexibility and testability without tight dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
2.1. GIVEN the ReaderCore component exists, WHEN it needs auto-page functionality, THEN it SHALL receive an IAutoPageService through dependency injection and NOT instantiate AutoPageManager directly.

2.2. GIVEN reading mode rendering is required, WHEN switching modes, THEN a ReadingModeRenderer base class SHALL define the interface with abstract methods: `buildView()`, `handlePageNavigation()`, and `preserveReadingPosition()`.

2.3. GIVEN gesture handling is implemented, WHEN defining gesture types, THEN a single GestureType enum SHALL be defined in the domain layer and used consistently across all components.

2.4. GIVEN widget construction occurs, WHEN creating reader components, THEN all service dependencies SHALL be provided through constructor parameters and NOT accessed via static service locators within widget build methods.

2.5. GIVEN component interfaces are defined, WHEN implementing concrete classes, THEN they SHALL implement their respective interfaces completely without missing method implementations.

### 3. Background Processing and Isolate Implementation

**User Story**: As a performance-conscious user, I need image processing and heavy operations to run in background isolates, so that the UI remains responsive at 60fps during all operations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
3.1. GIVEN large images need processing, WHEN decoding or resizing occurs, THEN operations SHALL run in dedicated Isolates using `Isolate.spawn()` with proper communication channels.

3.2. GIVEN preloading is active, WHEN loading adjacent pages, THEN the preloading engine SHALL use a background Isolate with priority-based queue management for next 3 pages (high priority) and next 5 pages (medium priority).

3.3. GIVEN memory cleanup is needed, WHEN cache eviction occurs, THEN cleanup operations SHALL run asynchronously without blocking the UI thread using `compute()` function or dedicated Isolate.

3.4. GIVEN background tasks are running, WHEN the app needs to respond to user input, THEN all Isolate operations SHALL be cancellable through CancelToken or similar mechanism.

3.5. GIVEN hardware acceleration is available, WHEN image rendering occurs, THEN the system SHALL configure Flutter's rendering pipeline to use hardware acceleration through proper RenderObject implementation.

### 4. Platform Channel Integration for Hardware Controls

**User Story**: As a mobile user, I need volume key navigation and platform-specific controls, so that I can use hardware buttons for comfortable reading in any position.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
4.1. GIVEN Android platform is targeted, WHEN volume keys are pressed, THEN a platform channel SHALL be implemented with proper Android KeyEvent interception in the MainActivity.kt file.

4.2. GIVEN iOS platform is targeted, WHEN volume keys are pressed, THEN a platform channel SHALL be implemented with proper iOS AVAudioSession category configuration and key event handling in the AppDelegate.swift file.

4.3. GIVEN platform channels are defined, WHEN implementing the Flutter side, THEN a VolumeKeyService SHALL use MethodChannel with proper error handling and null safety.

4.4. GIVEN file system access is required, WHEN handling file paths, THEN input validation SHALL prevent directory traversal attacks and ensure paths are within allowed application directories.

4.5. GIVEN platform integration occurs, WHEN errors happen in native code, THEN proper error codes and messages SHALL be passed through platform channels with appropriate Flutter exception handling.

### 5. Enhanced Error Recovery and Retry Mechanisms

**User Story**: As a user experiencing technical issues, I need robust error recovery with automatic retry and graceful degradation, so that temporary problems don't interrupt my reading experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
5.1. GIVEN network image loading fails, WHEN connection errors occur, THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry with maximum 3 attempts and increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s).

5.2. GIVEN archive extraction fails, WHEN corruption is detected, THEN the system SHALL attempt partial extraction of readable pages and provide detailed error reporting with recovery suggestions.

5.3. GIVEN memory pressure occurs, WHEN OutOfMemoryError is encountered, THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce image quality, clear non-essential caches, and continue operation with degraded performance.

5.4. GIVEN database operations fail, WHEN corruption is detected, THEN the system SHALL attempt database repair using PRAGMA integrity_check and rebuild corrupted tables if necessary.

5.5. GIVEN settings become corrupted, WHEN invalid values are detected, THEN the system SHALL reset to defaults, backup the corrupted settings for analysis, and notify the user with specific error details.

### 6. Comprehensive Testing Strategy Requirements

**User Story**: As a quality assurance engineer, I need comprehensive test coverage with specific metrics and accessibility compliance, so that the application meets professional software standards.

7.2. GIVEN CBR files are accessed, WHEN RAR extraction is needed, THEN the system SHALL implement platform-specific RAR handling with fallback to alternative extraction methods when native support is unavailable.

7.3. GIVEN archive validation is performed, WHEN integrity checking occurs, THEN the system SHALL verify archive headers, detect corruption patterns, and provide specific error messages with repair suggestions.

7.4. GIVEN large archives are processed, WHEN extraction happens, THEN progress reporting SHALL be provided through Stream<ExtractionProgress> with cancellation support via CancelToken.
