# Manga Reader App Critical Functionality Fixes - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical functionality failures in the Easy Comic Flutter manga reader application, with primary focus on the blank reading interface issue where manga files show gray/blank screens instead of displaying pages. The requirements encompass comprehensive debugging, repair, and enhancement of core functionality including file processing, reading interface, settings, WebDAV synchronization, database operations, file management, navigation, error handling, and logging.

## Requirements

### 1. Critical Reading Interface Repair

**1.1 Blank Screen Resolution**
