# Reader Enhancements Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhanced reading experience features for the Easy Comic Flutter application. The enhancements focus on improving user interaction, personalization, and navigation within the comic reader interface while maintaining compatibility with the existing WebDAV sync architecture and local-first data approach.

## Requirements

### 1. Reading Mode Management

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want to choose between different reading modes so that I can optimize my reading experience for different comic types and device orientations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user accesses reader settings, THEN the system SHALL provide single-page and dual-page viewing mode options

2. WHEN horizontal mode is selected, THEN the system SHALL enable left-right page flipping with swipe gestures
3. WHEN vertical mode is selected, THEN the system SHALL enable continuous scrolling through pages
4. WHEN navigation mode is changed, THEN the system SHALL preserve the current page position
5. WHEN using vertical mode, THEN the system SHALL maintain proper page boundaries and progress tracking

### 3. Enhanced Zoom and Gesture Controls

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want responsive zoom controls through gestures so that I can examine comic details comfortably.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user performs pinch-to-zoom gestures, THEN the system SHALL smoothly scale the comic page between 0.5x and 3.0x magnification
2. WHEN the user double-taps a page, THEN the system SHALL cycle between fit-to-screen and 2x zoom levels
3. WHEN a page is zoomed, THEN the system SHALL enable pan gestures to navigate the zoomed view
4. WHEN transitioning between pages while zoomed, THEN the system SHALL maintain the zoom level but reset pan position
5. WHEN zoom level exceeds readable bounds, THEN the system SHALL provide smooth zoom transition animations

### 4. Brightness Control System

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want to adjust screen brightness within the app so that I can read comfortably in different lighting conditions without affecting other apps.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user accesses reader controls, THEN the system SHALL display a brightness adjustment slider
2. WHEN the brightness is adjusted, THEN the system SHALL change only the app's display brightness, not system brightness
3. WHEN the app is closed and reopened, THEN the system SHALL restore the last used brightness setting
4. WHEN brightness is at minimum, THEN the system SHALL ensure content remains readable with sufficient contrast
5. WHEN brightness is at maximum, THEN the system SHALL not exceed safe viewing levels

### 5. Enhanced Bookmark Management

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want improved bookmark functionality so that I can easily mark and return to important comic pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user adds a bookmark, THEN the system SHALL allow optional page thumbnail capture for visual identification
2. WHEN viewing bookmark list, THEN the system SHALL display page thumbnails, page numbers, and custom labels
3. WHEN managing bookmarks, THEN the system SHALL provide batch delete and reorder capabilities
4. WHEN jumping to a bookmark, THEN the system SHALL provide smooth page transition animation
5. WHEN bookmarks exceed screen space, THEN the system SHALL provide scrollable bookmark list with search functionality

### 6. Reading History System

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want automatic reading history tracking so that I can easily return to recently read comics and pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN a comic is opened, THEN the system SHALL automatically record it in reading history
2. WHEN viewing reading history, THEN the system SHALL display last read page, reading date, and total progress
3. WHEN history entries exceed 50 items, THEN the system SHALL automatically remove oldest entries
4. WHEN accessing history, THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear individual entries or entire history
5. WHEN jumping from history, THEN the system SHALL open the comic at the last read page

### 7. Background Theme Customization

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want customizable background colors so that I can read in my preferred visual environment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user accesses reader settings, THEN the system SHALL provide preset background color options: black, dark gray, sepia, white, and green (eye-care)
2. WHEN a background color is selected, THEN the system SHALL immediately apply it to the reader interface
3. WHEN switching between comics, THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected background color
4. WHEN the background color changes, THEN the system SHALL ensure UI elements maintain sufficient contrast
5. WHEN using light backgrounds, THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust status bar and navigation bar colors

### 8. Page Transition Animations

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want different page transition effects so that I can personalize my reading experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user accesses reader settings, THEN the system SHALL provide transition options: none, slide, fade, and curl
2. WHEN slide transition is selected, THEN the system SHALL animate pages sliding left-right during navigation
3. WHEN fade transition is selected, THEN the system SHALL cross-fade between pages with configurable duration
4. WHEN curl transition is selected, THEN the system SHALL simulate page curl effect during navigation
5. WHEN transition animations are disabled, THEN the system SHALL provide instant page switching for performance

### 9. Enhanced Progress Navigation

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want an improved progress bar with thumbnail previews so that I can quickly navigate to specific pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user interacts with the progress slider, THEN the system SHALL display a thumbnail preview of the target page
2. WHEN dragging the progress slider, THEN the system SHALL provide real-time page number feedback
3. WHEN the progress bar is tapped, THEN the system SHALL immediately jump to the corresponding page
4. WHEN thumbnails are loading, THEN the system SHALL display placeholder indicators
5. WHEN memory usage is high, THEN the system SHALL implement thumbnail caching with automatic cleanup

### 10. Page Ordering Management

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want to customize page order through drag-and-drop so that I can correct incorrectly ordered comic pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user accesses page management interface, THEN the system SHALL display page thumbnails in a grid layout
2. WHEN the user drags a page thumbnail, THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and insertion indicators
3. WHEN page order is modified, THEN the system SHALL persist the custom order to the database
4. WHEN a comic has custom page order, THEN the system SHALL use the custom order for all reading sessions
5. WHEN custom page order is reset, THEN the system SHALL revert to filename-based alphabetical sorting

### 11. Settings Persistence and Sync

**User Story**: As a comic reader, I want my reader preferences saved and optionally synced so that my settings are consistent across sessions and devices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN reader settings are changed, THEN the system SHALL immediately persist settings to local storage
2. WHEN the app restarts, THEN the system SHALL restore all previously configured reader settings
3. WHEN WebDAV sync is enabled, THEN the system SHALL optionally sync reader preferences to the WebDAV server
4. WHEN settings are synced, THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts by preferring most recently modified settings
5. WHEN sync fails, THEN the system SHALL maintain local settings and retry sync in background

## Success Criteria

- All reading modes and navigation options function smoothly without performance degradation
- Settings persistence works reliably across app restarts and device reboots
- Gesture controls feel responsive and intuitive to users familiar with image viewing apps
- Database operations for bookmarks, history, and page ordering complete within 100ms
- Memory usage for thumbnail caching stays within reasonable bounds (< 50MB for thumbnails)
- Integration with existing WebDAV sync system maintains data consistency
- All new features maintain compatibility with existing comic archives and progress tracking
